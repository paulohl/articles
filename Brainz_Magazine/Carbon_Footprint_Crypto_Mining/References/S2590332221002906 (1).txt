Abstract: The digital currency Bitcoin is known for its energy hunger and associated carbon footprint. Investors, however, must not neglect further environmental, social, and governance issues related to digital currencies. Therefore, we urge the adoption of a more comprehensive view in assessing the externalities of investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
